## Project Components

### Market Analysis
- Evaluated global market trends, customer segments, and pricing models.
- Forecasted TAM/SAM/SOM using bottom-up demand estimation.
- Benchmarked against existing competitors to identify differentiation.

### Technical Feasibility & Process Design
- Designed high-level process flow diagrams and process block diagrams (PFDs).
- Estimated raw material and utility requirements using preliminary energy and material balances.
- Carried out cost-benefit analysis for different process routes.

### EHS (Environment, Health & Safety)
- Identified regulatory requirements and key safety protocols.
- Proposed sustainable waste management practices and emission control strategies.
- Performed HAZOP-style risk analysis to assess operational safety.

### Intellectual Property & Patents
- Conducted prior-art searches using Espacenet and Google Patents.
- Outlined draft patent claims for proprietary technology.
- Strategized IP positioning and commercialization scope.
